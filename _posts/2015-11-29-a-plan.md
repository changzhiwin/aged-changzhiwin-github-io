#Why
I want to be a freelancer, it's my dream currently;
Then, I can go anywhere, work anywhere;
Live in my hometown, live with my mom, live with freedom;
I know it hard.

#Now
My current job is programer that using javascript, I think using this program language is closer to my dream;
And I learn English everyday, memorize word, read simple article, watch TED talk.
But I still not ready for freelancer.

I have not any detail plan that can make my dream come to true.
There are so many popular frameworks that using those days, like angular, react, ionic, 
but I don't know which one I should master.

#How
Today, I choose angular2, learn typescript.
I don't know this choice is right or wrong, yes, it's a bet
